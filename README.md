# 🧮 NumPy Practice for Data Science

Welcome to my **NumPy Practice Repository**!  
This repository documents my hands-on journey of learning **NumPy** for data science through structured exercises, self-solved challenges, and guided evaluations.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

After completing a **NumPy for Data Science** course on YouTube,  
I wanted to **test and deepen my understanding** through small exercises.

So, I asked **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** to give me a complete set of practice questions ranging from beginner to advanced levels.  
I solved every question **by myself first**, and then had ChatGPT **review, rate, and give professional feedback** on my solutions.

This process helped me:
- Build stronger confidence in array manipulation
- Understand vectorization, slicing, and broadcasting deeply
- Learn how to write clean, efficient, and readable NumPy code

## 🧩 Topics Practiced

✅ Array creation and attributes  
✅ Indexing and slicing  
✅ Boolean masking and filtering  
✅ Handling missing values (`np.nan`)  
✅ Broadcasting and reshaping  
✅ Statistical operations (mean, median, std, normalization)
